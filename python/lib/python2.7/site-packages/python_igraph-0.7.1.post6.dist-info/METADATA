Python interface to the igraph high performance graph
library, primarily aimed at complex network research and analysis.

Graph plotting functionality is provided by the Cairo library, so make
sure you install the Python bindings of Cairo if you want to generate
publication-quality graph plots.

See the `Cairo homepage <http://cairographics.org/pycairo>`_ for details.

>From release 0.5, the C core of the igraph library is **not** included
in the Python distribution - you must compile and install the C core
separately. Windows installers already contain a compiled igraph DLL,
so they should work out of the box. Linux users should refer to the
`igraph homepage <http://igraph.org>`_ for
compilation instructions (but check your distribution first, maybe
there are pre-compiled packages available). OS X users may
benefit from the disk images in the Python Package Index.

Unofficial installers for 64-bit Windows machines and/or different Python
versions can also be found `here <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs>`_.
